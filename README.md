# AHOME
## Context:
Itâ€™s as part of a school project (in duo) of 2nd year of engineering school that we started programming an horror, action and survival game in a text version in the terminal. We were also inspired by the gameplay of the horror game Dead by Daylight.

## Gameplay:
The goal is to repair 3 generators to escape the place and a killer who is looking for you. You can also collect items such as a medical kit or a toolbox to give you an advantage in your game. Be careful, if the killer finds you, you will have to be fast to escape. 

### Commands:
In this section, all the commands you need to know to play :
- `help` : show all commands available,
- `quit` : quit the game,
- `reparer` : repair a generator,
- `prendre` : take a medkit or a toolbox on the floor,
- `heal` : use a medkit to heal yourself,
- `outil` : use a toolbox to repair instantly the generator,
- `go` + `haut` or `bas` or `droite` or `gauche` or `up`or `down` : move in the direction indicated.

> Words partially written or with small misspellings will be understood by the game. Capital letters are not taken into account.

## Features:
- Two difficulty modes are available and result in different maps and faster skill tests,
- Map and information are displayed in the terminal and the player represented by a star,
- Player has two lives,
- To win you need to repair 3 generators and exit from the exit room,
- A generator is repaired in several times unless you have a tool box (it's instant),
- Recoverable items are for single use and only one can be taken at a time,
- By using the medkit, you earn a life,
- If you are in the same room as the killer, a skill test starts (calculation or writing a letter). If you succeed, you dodge the hit else you lose a life,
- The presence of a generator or object in a room is indicated next to the room name in brackets.

> Some values such as the number of lives, skill tests, the number of items, of generators can be modified in the "customPreset.txt" file. Don't modify the values in "defaultPreset.txt" file.

> Your statistics are also available in "saveData.txt" file. You can delete the old one (his creation is automatic).
